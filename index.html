This is the second branch and to be honest i dont know what i am doing 
but nevertheless i am not planning to stop anytime soon
see you on the next one
and this is an edit of my repository from sublimne text
i just figured out i could do this and commit it to the page from here
cool right?
thats how i like it
it's late in the night but i am still here
alright i think i just figured something out
it is not directly updating on my static git site even though i have browser sync running.
i still have to reload the page after saving to see my changes take effect
and i do not know why mine is different
but i will manage
commit to main
push to origin
